		<h2><p><center>Welcome to RelDeep !</center></p></h2>

		<p><center><b>Goal</b></center></p>

		<p>• Our goal is to make human relationships stronger & deeper by recommending clever & specific personlized daily actions. <br>
			• We act like a mentor/life coach to you. Who serve you with daily actions to take, to make you more deeply connected withy our own people. <br>
			• Also like a mentor/life coach we want to serve people by modifying the way they look at things in +ve way.
		</p><br>
		
		<p><b><center>Some FAQs.</center></b></p>

		<p><b>Why we need to keep connected with people?</b></p>
		<p>• A real connection with live thing is required. Whether it's cat, dog or a human. But human have kind of same problems & emotions as you have. So, that should be 1st choice.<br>
                • A deep connection is a win-win. Both person get chance to share their happiness & problems.<br>
                • Now here's a cool thing. When you share problems, total stress is divided between people. Unlike, when you share happiness, joy remains same as everyone feel same amount of joy.<br>
                • Joy only increases as we share, while tension is divided as we share.</p><br>

        <p><b>Why do healthy relationships matter?</b></p>
        <p>• Relationship is the highest correlated factor with your happiness & mental health. Not fame, huge bungalow etc.<br>
                • No matter how much one have achieved in terms of money, fame, power; if he/she isn't deeply connected with some people & can't share his/her problems, happiness with others, a true satisfaction can't be achieved.<br>
                • So, ideally, healthy relationships with some people should be the very first priority of everyone.</p><br>

        <p><b>How we recommend actions?</b></p>
        <p>• In simple terms, we take all the data provided by you, we analyse it, and we give (naive + smart) recommendaions keeping in mind, ideally, what should be the case.<br>
                • Like, ideally, you should be more close to your parents or partner or child. If you're not, we tell you to take these actions to connect more with them.<br>
                • Also, we look at other people's reactions to your actions; to predict, whether you two should even connect or not in the first place.<br>
                • Ultimately, just like a mentor/life coach do, our goal is to modify people's mindset in +ve way by giving new perspectives to look at things.</p><br>
